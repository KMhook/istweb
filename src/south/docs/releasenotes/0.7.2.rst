===========
South 0.7.2
===========

This is a minor new release of South, and the second bugfix release for the 
:ref:`0.7 series <0-7-release-notes>`.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None.


Changes
=======

Ordering of actions
-------------------

A few issues with ordering of index deletion versus field/table deletion have
now been fixed, so hopefully things will delete or migrate backwards first time.

blank
-----

If you have a CharField or TextField with blank=True, you now no longer need
to specify a default value. In addition, changes to blank no longer trigger
an alteration migration for that field, since it doesn't affect the database.

Schemas
-------

South should now work if you aren't using the 'public' schema; you'll need to
set the SCHEMA database setting first, though.

Arguments
---------

A bit of tidying up has been done for arguments; `migrate` now accepts `--noinput`
and `convert_to_south` accepts the ghost migration options.

Other changes
-------------

A whole assortment of minor bugs has been fixed; for the complete list, see
the `milestone in our Trac <http://south.aeracode.org/query?group=status&milestone=0.7.2>`_.
