===========
South 0.7.1
===========

This is a minor new release of South, and the first bugfix release for the 
:ref:`0.7 series <0-7-release-notes>`.


Backwards incompatible changes
==============================

None.


Changes
=============

South tests
-----------

South's internal test suite now doesn't run by default (the ``SKIP_SOUTH_TESTS``
setting now defaults to True). This is mainly because the test suite is meant
to be run in isolation (the test framework continually changes
``INSTALLED_APPS`` and fiddles with the ORM as it runs, among other things), and
was causing compatability problems with other applications.

If you wish to run the tests still, simply set ``SKIP_SOUTH_TESTS = False``.

Data Migrations
---------------

There was an annoying issue that caused failing data migrations under MySQL
to suddenly run their backwards() method and produce an error completely
unrelated to the original problem. This has been fixed.

Commands
--------

``./manage.py migrate`` has gained a new ``--ignore-ghost-migrations``, which
will temporarily silence South's complaining about missing migrations on disk
if you really know what you're doing (i.e. temporary branch switching).

In addition, --noinput is now correctly respected for the "./manage.py migrate"
command.

Dependencies
------------

A bug and some nondeterminism in the new dependency engine has been fixed
(previously, dependencies were sometimes calculated wrongly, and the
non-determinism meant that this only happened on certain architectures).

Other changes
-------------

A whole assortment of minor bugs has been fixed; for the complete list, see
the `milestone in our Trac <http://south.aeracode.org/query?group=status&milestone=0.7.1>`_.
