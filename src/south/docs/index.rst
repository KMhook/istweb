South documentation
===================

South is a tool to provide consistent, easy-to-use and database-agnostic
migrations for Django applications.

This is the documentation for the current version (0.7); previous versions'
documentation was written directly into our wiki, but is mostly a subset of
what is written here.

If you want to view the old docs (for example, if you need something that was
only in 0.6) they're `still available <http://south.aeracode.org/wiki/OldDocumentation>`_.

Support
-------

For initial help with problems, see our `mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/south-users>`_, or `#django-south <irc://irc.freenode.net/django-south>`_ on `freenode <http://freenode.net/>`_. If you find a real bug, then `file a new ticket <http://south.aeracode.org/newticket>`_.
