Tutorial
========

This is South's new tutorial, designed to give a reasonably comprehensive
grounding in all of the basic features of South. We recommend you work through
from the beginning if you're new, or dip in if you already know about some of
the features.

Advanced features have their own extensive documentation, as well; the 
:ref:`main page <index>` gives you an overview of all the topics.
